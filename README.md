- Dynamic HTML rendering with EJS
- Reusable UI components using partials
- Simple, fun UI for name generation

## 📍 The Process

This project was built while learning **Section 24 and Section 25 of The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp**.

In Section 24, the focus was on backend fundamentals using Express. This included setting up an Express server, understanding HTTP requests, working with middleware, parsing form data, serving static files, and using tools like Postman to explore requests without a frontend. Concepts such as custom middleware, logging, and the `next()` function were also introduced.

In Section 25, EJS was introduced to solve the problem of rendering dynamic content. This project uses `res.render()` to generate HTML dynamically, passes data safely using `locals`, and uses EJS partials to reuse common UI elements like headers and footers. Static assets are served using Express, and form input is used to generate dynamic output on the page.

This project was created as a focused application of the concepts learned so far.
